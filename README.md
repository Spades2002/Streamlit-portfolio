# Real-time Object & Color Detection System  

**A computer vision project combining YOLOv8 object detection with KNN color classification**  

As a graduate Robotics Engineer passionate about perception systems, I developed this application to demonstrate real-time object detection with precise color identification. The system uses a webcam feed to detect objects (via YOLOv8) while simultaneously classifying colors at the frame's center point (using KNN trained on RGB values).

## Key Features  
- **Dual Detection Pipeline**:  
  - Object detection with pre-trained YOLOv8n (80 COCO classes)  
  - Color classification using K-Nearest Neighbours  

- **Interactive Visualization**:  
  - Bounding boxes for detected objects with labels  
  - Dynamic color recognition with Â±20 RGB tolerance range  
  - Contour detection for dominant color regions  

- **Modular Architecture**:  
  - Separates color data loading (CSV) from ML inference  
  - Configurable KNN parameters for color matching  

## Tech Stack  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV  
- **Object Detection**: Ultralytics YOLOv8  
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn KNN  
- **Data Handling**: pandas, numpy  

## Installation & Usage  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.11
- Webcam  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Spades2002/Other-Project-1]
cd object-color-detection
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas scikit-learn ultralytics
```

### 3. Download Required Files
- Place colors.csv in the project root (get it from Kaggle or include in repo)
- YOLOv8 weights will auto-download on first run or included in repo


### 4. Run the Application
```bash
python color_object_detector.py
```
